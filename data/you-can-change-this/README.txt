You can change these settings without being a programmer.

Open settings.txt and edit the words after the colon.

Examples:
- Wi‑Fi Name: My Home WiFi
- Wi‑Fi Password: MySecret123
- Web Address Name: printer-cam
- LED Brightness (0-255): 40
- Picture Speed (seconds): 2

Notes:
- Don’t delete the part before the colon. Only change what’s after it.
- Keep numbers simple (like 2 or 10). The device understands seconds.
- If something breaks, just put it back to how it was and restart the device.
