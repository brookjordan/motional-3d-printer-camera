ESP32-S3 N16R8 CAM Development Board Overview

Processor and Memory Specifications

The board is built around the ESP32-S3 microcontroller (ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module) featuring a dual-core Xtensa LX7 CPU running at up to 240 MHz. The ESP32-S3 has 512 KB of internal SRAM and 384 KB of ROM, and this particular variant includes 16 MB of external flash and 8 MB of PSRAM (denoted by “N16R8”) for ample program storage and data buffering. The flash and PSRAM are connected via the ESP32-S3’s high-speed SPI interfaces; note that GPIOs 26–32 are used internally for the flash/PSRAM and are not exposed for general use.

Wireless connectivity is provided by the ESP32-S3’s integrated 2.4 GHz radio, supporting Wi-Fi 4 (802.11 b/g/n up to 150 Mbps) and Bluetooth 5 Low Energy (with BLE Mesh) using a shared PCB antenna. The chip also features hardware acceleration for cryptography (AES, SHA, RSA, etc.) and includes vector instructions to accelerate neural network and signal processing tasks for AI/ML workloads. The operating voltage is 3.3 V (on-board regulator from 5 V USB input), with the ESP32-S3 rated for an industrial temperature range (–40 °C to 85 °C).

Integrated Peripherals: The ESP32-S3 SoC provides a rich set of peripherals available to the board. This includes 45 GPIOs (most broken out on this board), with 20 ADC channels, 14 capacitive touch sensors, 3 UARTs, 2 I²C and 2 I²S controllers, 4 SPI interfaces (two typically used for flash/PSRAM), 16 channels of LED PWM (for analog/PWM output), a USB 1.1 OTG interface, a 8-bit DVP camera interface, an LCD interface, a CAN (TWAI) interface, GPIO matrix for flexible IO mapping, DMA controllers, timers, watchdogs, and more. Notably, the ESP32-S3 adds a native USB Serial/JTAG controller, allowing programming and debugging via USB without an external UART in some configurations, and the on-board USB OTG port can be used for USB devices or host functionality (e.g. HID devices, mass storage, etc.).

Board Features and Components

Front and back of the ESP32-S3 N16R8 CAM board, with key components labeled (dual USB Type-C ports, camera connector, microSD slot, etc.).

This development board is designed for camera applications and includes several on-board components and interface connectors:
• Camera Interface: A 24-pin FPC connector at the top of the board provides an 8-bit DVP parallel camera interface, supporting common camera modules like the OV2640 (2 MP), OV5640 (5 MP) and others【28†】. The interface includes signals for 8 data lines (D0–D7), XCLK (clock out to camera), PCLK (pixel clock in), VSYNC, HREF, and I²C control (SIOC, SIOD) for the camera sensor. (No on-board camera is included by default, but the OV2640 module is typically used; the board as sold often bundles a detachable OV2640 camera module.) The ESP32-S3’s internal camera controller is used to capture images from this interface at up to 40 MHz pixel clock. (Note: The specific GPIO assignments for camera signals are configured in software. For example, one typical configuration uses GPIO0 for XCLK, and various free GPIOs for D0–D7 and sync signals, but the exact mapping on this board should follow its schematic.)
• MicroSD Card Slot: A microSD (TF) card slot is provided on the back of the board【28†】. This is wired to the ESP32-S3 to allow using the SDIO 4-bit SD/MMC host interface for high-speed storage, or it can be used in SPI mode. In an example configuration, the SD card lines might use pins like GPIO40–47 for SDMMC (the S3 supports up to 4-bit SD mode) or corresponding GPIOs via the GPIO matrix. In practice, the Arduino SD_MMC library can be used to mount the card (the exact pins are set in software when calling SD_MMC.begin()). The SD card enables logging or storing images captured from the camera.
• Dual USB Type-C Ports: Uniquely, the board features two USB-C connectors. One is a USB-UART port (connected to an onboard USB-to-Serial converter, for programming and serial monitoring), and the other is a direct USB OTG port connected to the ESP32-S3’s native USB interface【28†】. The USB-UART port is based on a CH340/CH343 serial chip (seen as “CH343P” on the board) and is labeled “COM” or “UART” – this provides a classic serial COM port for uploading code (if not using native USB) and debugging. The USB OTG port is wired to the ESP32-S3’s USB D–/D+ pins (GPIO19=D-, GPIO20=D+ ￼) and supports the S3’s native USB functionality. This allows the board to act as a USB device (e.g. mass storage, HID, CDC serial via the internal USB serial/JTAG) or even host modest USB gadgets (note: 5 V supply for USB devices would come from the 5 V input). Only one port is needed to program the board: you can use the native USB port by putting the S3 in USB boot mode, or simply use the UART port with the ROM bootloader as on classic dev boards. Both ports are USB-C and can power the board. Power can be supplied via either port (5 V), regulated by the on-board 3.3 V regulator.
• Buttons: The board includes two push buttons. The RESET (EN) button resets the ESP32-S3 by pulling the EN pin low, and the BOOT button pulls the IO0 strapping pin low for entering download mode. These are typically used for manual programming (the CH340C chip also toggles these lines automatically for uploading). The BOOT button doubles as a user input if IO0 is needed in running code (bearing in mind it’s a strapping pin – it must be high for normal boot).
• LEDs: There are multiple LEDs on board. A power LED (labeled “ON”) indicates 3.3 V is present. There are serial TX/RX indicator LEDs attached to the UART lines (these flash during data transmission via the CH340C). In addition, the board has a user-programmable LED and a RGB LED:
• A single white LED (flash lamp) is connected to a GPIO (commonly IO34) and positioned near the camera connector – it can act as a flash or status LED (the Arduino example defines LED on GPIO34 ￼).
• An RGB LED (WS2812 addressable LED) is on the board (labeled as WS2812), driven by a single data pin (commonly GPIO33). This allows multicolor status indication; for example, it can be driven using the NeoPixel library or the neopixelWrite() function as shown in sample code.
• Additional Interfaces: All remaining ESP32-S3 GPIOs are broken out to 0.1″ header pins on the sides (with male headers typically included loose). Notably, the board exposes the 14 capacitive touch pins (GPIO1–GPIO14 correspond to touch sensor channels T1–T14) ￼ and all the ADC capable pins (GPIO1–GPIO20 are ADC inputs as listed in the pinout below). Standard serial peripherals (UART, I2C, SPI, I2S) can be assigned to various pins via ESP-IDF or Arduino frameworks, since the S3 uses a GPIO matrix for flexibility. For example, the board can support a secondary hardware UART or I2C on the broken-out pins if needed for additional sensors or modules. It also has support for an external UART/JTAG: the S3’s internal USB-JTAG means you typically debug via the USB port, but if needed the external JTAG signals (MTMS, MTDI, MTCK, MTDO on GPIO42/41/39/40 respectively) are also available on the headers for use with an external JTAG adapter.
• Power Supply: The board can be powered via USB (5 V) or via the VIN/5V header pin. It includes a 3.3 V regulator (e.g. AMS1117-3.3) to power the ESP32-S3 and peripherals. The 5 V from USB is also available on the 5V header pin (for example, to drive an external 5 V component like certain sensors or to supply the camera’s 2.8 V regulator on the module). There is an automatic bootstrapping circuit on the CH340C for resetting/boot mode during programming, and an LDO regulator providing 3.3 V at sufficient current for the ESP32-S3 (which can draw around 240 mA peak with Wi-Fi active). A 5 V output pad may be present (some boards have a solder jumper to enable 5 V output on a pin or connector when USB is plugged in). All GPIO operate at 3.3 V logic.
• Dimensions: The PCB measures approximately 62.6 mm × 28.3 mm (about 2.46″ × 1.11″) in size ￼, and the header pins are spaced 2.54 mm (0.1″) apart with a standard 2×19 dual-inline layout (fits on breadboards). The board has four mounting holes (one near each corner). Due to the dual USB ports and camera connector, the form factor is slightly longer than a typical ESP32 DevKitC.

Pinout and GPIO Functions

The ESP32-S3 N16R8 CAM board breaks out most pins of the ESP32-S3 module to two 19-pin headers (38 header pins total, including power and ground). Figure 1 below shows a reference pinout diagram with color-coded functions for this board’s pins:

Each GPIO on the ESP32-S3 can generally be used for digital I/O and for one or more alternate functions, with certain exceptions and default uses. The table below summarizes each pin on the board, its GPIO number, and notable functions or default usage on this dev board:

| 3V3 (power) | –      | 3.3 V supply output (regulated). Power the board with 3.3 V here (if not using 5 V) or use as output to power external devices (up to ~500 mA).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| EN          | – (EN) | Reset (Chip Enable) pin. Held low to reset the ESP32-S3. Controlled by the EN button and auto-reset circuit. Typically not broken out on header in some boards, but on this board the EN button is provided instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| GPIO0       | IO0    | Strapping pin for boot mode (internal pull-up). Connected to BOOT button (pressing pulls it low for UART download mode) ￼ ￼. Camera XCLK in some designs (if so, provides clock to camera – the example config uses IO0 for XCLK ￼). No ADC or touch function. Avoid pulling low on reset except for programming. Available on header for use if care is taken with boot mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| GPIO1       | IO1    | ADC1_CH0, Touch1 ￼ ￼. Default not used by on-board hardware. Can be used as a general IO, and is a candidate for CAM SIOD (I2C SDA) for camera config in this board (typical if 26/27 are unavailable). Available on header.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| GPIO2       | IO2    | ADC1_CH1, Touch2. Not used internally. Broken out on header. Can be used for I2C SCL for camera (if IO1 is SDA) or as general I/O. On some ESP32 boards IO2 is strapping, but on ESP32-S3 it is not a boot strapping pin, so free to use (it was often used for on-board LED in ESP32 boards – here it might be tied to an LED labeled “ON” if that LED is software-controlled). Otherwise, GPIO2 is a general-purpose pin on S3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| GPIO3       | IO3    | ADC1_CH2, Touch3. Broken out. No special function by default on this board. Useable for general I/O or as an analog input.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| GPIO4       | IO4    | ADC1_CH3, Touch4. Broken out. No on-board use. (On original ESP32-CAM, IO4 was camera flash LED; on S3-CAM board, flash is on IO34 instead.) Free for use, analog capable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| GPIO5       | IO5    | ADC1_CH4, Touch5. Broken out. No on-board use. Can be used as general I/O or analog in. (In some camera setups, IO5 might serve as one of the data lines D0–D7; for example, often Y2 = IO5 in certain configs ￼. It’s broken out, so if the camera uses it, avoid reusing it while camera is in use.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| GPIO6       | IO6    | ADC1_CH5, Touch6. Broken out. No on-board use. General-purpose (note: on S3, GPIO6 is not used for flash as it was on original ESP32 – the S3’s external flash uses IO26-32 instead).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| GPIO7       | IO7    | ADC1_CH6, Touch7. Broken out. No on-board use. General I/O.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| GPIO8       | IO8    | ADC1_CH7, Touch8. CAM VSYNC signal is connected to this pin on the board【33†】. (It is used by the camera for frame sync – likely chosen because GPIO8 is an RTC GPIO with input capability and not used by flash/PSRAM.) If not using camera, it can serve as a normal analog/digital input. Otherwise, reserved for camera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| GPIO9       | IO9    | ADC1_CH8, Touch9. Likely connected to one of the camera data lines (e.g. CAM D7 or similar) in this design. Not confirmed in text, but given typical mappings, IO9 might serve as one of Y2–Y9. If camera is active, avoid reusing. Otherwise available (also note IO9 is an RTC IO).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| GPIO10      | IO10   | ADC1_CH9, Touch10. Another candidate used for camera data or control signals. (In the example pin map, IO18/19/21 etc. were used for data – but this board may wire some lower IOs for data as well.) Broken out, can be used for other purposes if camera function on it is not enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| GPIO11      | IO11   | ADC2_CH0, Touch11. Broken out. Could be used for camera D# as well (original ESP32-CAM used IO11 for D9). If not, general I/O (analog input on ADC2 – note ADC2 pins cannot be used for analog readings at the same time Wi-Fi is active ￼).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| GPIO12      | IO12   | ADC2_CH1, Touch12. Broken out, possibly used for camera D# line.

| GPIO14      | IO14   | ADC2_CH3, Touch14. Broken out. Also serves as JTAG MTMS (test mode select) in default config ￼. If using external JTAG, this pin is MTMS. On this board it’s available; if not debugging, can be used as GPIO (ADC2).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| GPIO15      | IO15   | ADC2_CH4. Broken out. Also default JTAG MTDO (test data out) on S3 (despite the numbering difference, S3’s JTAG signals are on high GPIOs) – actually on S3, MTDO is GPIO40, not 15. So GPIO15 here is free for use, no built-in JTAG. It has no touch. On some boards, IO15 might be used for camera XCLK (the pin diagram suggests CAM XCLK on IO15)【33†】. If so, it outputs the camera clock. Otherwise general use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| GPIO19      | IO19   | ADC2_CH8, also USB D- function ￼. Connected to USB OTG port (D– line) on this board. Avoid using as GPIO if using the native USB port. If not using USB, it can be repurposed, but note it’s also an RTC IO. (Not typically used for camera due to USB function, though in one camera config IO19 was used as D4 ￼, it likely isn’t here to preserve USB.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| GPIO20      | IO20   | ADC2_CH9, also USB D+ function ￼. Connected to USB OTG port (D+ line). Same considerations as GPIO19: available only if USB not needed. (Not used for other onboard functions.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| GPIO21      | IO21   | (no ADC, no touch – note, touch inputs are only 1–14). Broken out. Often used for camera data (e.g. Y5 in example was IO21) ￼. Could also be used for other peripherals (IO21 is a common SDA/SCL pin for user I2C on many dev boards since it’s free and not ADC). No special hardware on this board uses IO21 except possibly camera D5.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| GPIO22      | IO22   | (no ADC/touch). Broken out. Often used for CAM PCLK (pixel clock) – in the example mapping, PCLK is IO22 ￼. If so, that’s its main use (an input from camera). Otherwise, IO22 is free for things like I2C or UART.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| GPIO23      | IO23   | (no ADC/touch). Broken out. Often used for CAM HREF (horizontal sync) – example uses IO23 for HREF/HSYNC ￼. If so, used as input from camera. Otherwise general purpose (IO23 was also MOSI on original ESP32, but on S3 that’s different).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| GPIO24      | IO24   | (no ADC/touch). Broken out. No specific on-board function – likely a free GPIO. (Could be used for camera D? if needed – though example didn’t use 24 for camera, it’s available).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| GPIO25      | IO25   | (no ADC/touch; 25 is an RTC IO though). Broken out. In some camera setups, IO25 is used for VSYNC (example had VSYNC on 25) ￼, but on this board VSYNC was mapped to IO8 as noted. So IO25 might actually be unused here, leaving it free or possibly used for another camera data line. Keep in mind IO25 is also an RTC IO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| GPIO26–32   | –      | Flash/PSRAM interface pins – not available as GPIOs on this board. These pins are connected to the external flash and PSRAM (e.g. IO30=CLK, IO29=Flash CS, IO26=PSRAM CS, etc.) ￼. They are not broken out to headers and should not be used in software for other purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| GPIO33      | IO33   | (no ADC/touch). On-board WS2812 RGB LED data. Connected to the addressable RGB LED on the board ￼. You can control the LED with this pin (it’s not a plain GPIO output LED but a programmable RGB LED). It is also broken out on the header, so you may use it as a general IO if you are not driving the RGB LED (the LED won’t interfere unless you attempt to use the pin for something else). Also supports PWM/LEDC for dimming if controlling as plain output (for the WS2812, use dedicated library).                                                                                                                                                                  |
| GPIO34      | IO34   | (no ADC/touch; GPIO34–39 on S3 are input only in some ESP32 variants – but on ESP32-S3, GPIO34 is actually output-capable because S3 has different pad mappings for 34–46 which are not input-only as on original ESP32). On this board, GPIO34 drives the on-board white LED (flash) ￼. It can be used as a digital output to turn the LED on/off (HIGH/LOW logic depending on wiring). It is also broken out on the header for use as an input (if not driving the LED). If using the LED, avoid also driving that header with another device.                                                                                                                              |
| GPIO35      | IO35   | (no ADC/touch). Broken out. No dedicated use on board. GPIO35 is a general-purpose digital (S3 allows using 35 freely; note on S3, 35 is not input-only, it can do output as well). It might correspond to a camera D? signal in some mapping but likely not used here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| GPIO36      | IO36   | (no ADC/touch). Broken out. No on-board use. (In example, IO36 was used for camera D6) ￼. Possibly used for one of camera’s higher data bits. Otherwise free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| GPIO37      | IO37   | (no ADC/touch). Broken out. No on-board use. General-purpose digital. (GPIO37– Forty range have extra capabilities like support for clock outputs etc. Also note, GPIO37/38 can be used for USB Serial/JTAG if internal USB is not used, but normally that is internal. Generally free to use.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| GPIO38      | IO38   | (no ADC/touch). Broken out. No dedicated use. (GPIO38 is associated with the ESP32-S3’s internal USB-JTAG by default, but the internal USB-JTAG controller uses fixed pins 38-43 only when USB Device is not in use ￼ ￼; since we have a native USB port, those might be engaged. Typically, though, the internal USB-JTAG and USB-serial function also use 19/20 or 40+ pins – this is complex, but effectively you can still use 38 as GPIO in user applications).                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| GPIO39      | IO39   | (no ADC/touch). Broken out. JTAG MTCK (JTAG clock) default function ￼. If not debugging via external JTAG, can be used as a normal output/input. No on-board hardware tied to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| GPIO40      | IO40   | (no ADC/touch). Broken out. JTAG MTDO (JTAG data out) default ￼ ￼. Also labelled as GPIO40. Free for use if JTAG not needed. (This pin was used as a camera data bit (Y7) in example code ￼ on another board, but on this board it’s likely left for JTAG/IO use.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| GPIO41      | IO41   | (no ADC/touch). Broken out. JTAG MTDI (data in) default ￼. Otherwise general I/O. Possibly used for camera I2C SCL/SDA in some design, but not confirmed – more likely left for JTAG or user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

No on-board use by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| GPIO43      | IO43   | (no ADC/touch). U0TXD – UART0 transmit output ￼. This board connects GPIO43 to the TXD input of the USB-UART chip (CH340C). Labeled TX0 on the board header. Used for the primary serial output (console). You can use it for printing logs or as a general TX for UART. It’s also available as a GPIO if the UART is not needed, but generally it’s best to reserve for serial. (Note: The ESP32-S3 ROM uses this UART0 for boot messages by default, on IO43/44 at 115200 baud).                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| GPIO44      | IO44   | U0RXD – UART0 receive input ￼. Connected to the RXD output of the CH340C. Labeled RX0 on the header. Used for uploading code (receiving from PC) and as the main serial input. If not using the hardware serial, it can be used as a general input, but typically leave it for UART0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| GPIO45      | IO45   | (no ADC/touch). Strapping pin for SPI flash voltage (VDD_SPI) selection on some modules (internal pull-down) ￼. It’s exposed on the header (appears as IO45). Caution: altering this at reset could affect flash power mode. Generally, treat as a reserved or input-only pin at boot. After boot, it can function as a normal GPIO. No specific hardware on board uses GPIO45.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| GPIO46      | IO46   | (no ADC/touch). Strapping pin for USB Boot/Serial print control (internal pull-down; also involved in selecting boot mode with GPIO0) ￼. This pin must be low at reset for the UART Download boot mode to be enabled (it’s typically pulled down internally, and for normal flash boot it doesn’t matter because GPIO0 is high) ￼. Important: This pin is broken out (labeled IO46) and should generally be left un-driven at reset. After boot, it can be used as a normal IO. On this board, IO46 is not tied to other hardware, so it’s available for the user with care. For instance, it could be used as an output for a user LED or input from a sensor after startup. |
| 5V (power)  | –      | 5 V input/output. If using USB, this pin outputs ~5 V (USB voltage) that can power external modules (note: directly connected to USB 5V through a polyfuse or diode typically). It can also be used to externally supply the board with 5 V (e.g. from a battery boost converter or bench supply).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| GND         | –      | Ground. (Multiple ground pins are usually provided; one on each header end. Connect to system ground.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Notes: Many of the S3’s GPIOs are multi-function. For example, nearly all GPIOs can be used as PWM outputs for LED control (the ESP32-S3’s LEDC PWM controller has up to 8 channels that can be assigned to any GPIO pins). I2C can be assigned to any free GPIOs (commonly SDA=S3 GPIO1 or 2, SCL=GPIO2 or 1 in this board’s context if used for camera control, or you can use others for user I2C). SPI interfaces (VSPI, HSPI in Arduino terms) can also map to arbitrary pins via the GPIO matrix, although it’s typical to use certain pins for better timing. UART2 (and UART1 if not used for debug) can be mapped as well if a second hardware serial port is needed for, say, a GPS or another device.

Analog: GPIO1–20 can be used as analog inputs (ADC). ADC1 has 10 channels (GPIO1–10) and ADC2 has 10 channels (GPIO11–20). (Note that ADC2 channels are unavailable during Wi-Fi use due to Wi-Fi driver using ADC2 – this is an ESP32 restriction ￼). The table above indicates which pins correspond to which ADC channel (e.g. IO5 = ADC1_CH4 ￼, IO18 = ADC2_CH7 ￼, etc.). Similarly, the 14 touch sensors are on GPIO1–14 as noted ￼ – using these capacitive touch inputs requires those pins not be heavily coupled to other circuitry. On this board, those pins are broken out and not used by other on-board hardware except: note that if the camera is using some of them (e.g. IO8 is Touch8 but also VSYNC), that touch channel would not be free while camera in use.

Strapping Pins: Be cautious with GPIO0, GPIO45, and GPIO46 as noted – they are involved in boot configuration. Particularly, GPIO0 must be pulled high on reset for normal boot (it is, via internal pull-up; the BOOT button pulls it low), and GPIO46 must remain at its default (internal pull-down) for the normal boot mode (it controls log output to USB or UART depending on its state). The board’s design honors this, so just avoid driving GPIO46 at boot. After reset, you can use them normally (for instance, some users repurpose IO0 as a general output in running application, but remember not to hold it low at reset).

Camera and SD Card Support

One of the main features of this board is its support for a camera and microSD card for image capture and storage. The ESP32-S3’s camera interface (8-bit DVP) is connected to the 24-pin camera connector which supports modules like the OV2640, OV3660, OV5640, etc.【28†】. The camera modules typically come with a ribbon cable that plugs into the FPC connector. In software (ESP-IDF or Arduino with the esp_camera library), you will need to specify the GPIO pins for the camera signals. While the exact pin mapping for this board wasn’t provided in text, a typical mapping for an ESP32-S3 camera board (from Espressif’s examples) is as follows for reference ￼ ￼:
• XCLK -> GPIO0 (clock to camera)
• PCLK -> GPIO22 (pixel clock in)
• VSYNC -> GPIO8 or 25 (vertical sync – this board uses IO8 for VSYNC as noted)
• HREF -> GPIO23 (horizontal sync)
• D0 through D7 -> e.g. GPIO5, 18, 19, 21, 36, 39, 34, 35 (this is one example assignment; this board likely uses a similar set, mixing some low and high GPIOs) ￼
• SIOC (camera I2C SCL) -> GPIO1 or 41 (needs confirmation; commonly IO27 on some boards, but S3 can route freely since 26/27 are not usable here, they likely chose an available pin like 1 and 2)
• SIOD (camera I2C SDA) -> GPIO2 or 42

The OV2640 camera is controlled via I2C (a.k.a. SCCB) and the above pins SIOC/SIOD are how the ESP32 configures the camera sensor registers. The camera’s reset and power-down pins are often not used (tied to ESP32 reset or always enabled). On this board, there is no separate camera power-down control, the camera module is powered when the board is powered.

Given the lack of an official schematic in text form, if you are using Arduino’s CameraWebServer example, select the “ESP32-S3 Eye” or similar configuration which is known to work – users have reported that using the ESP32-S3 Dev Module plus selecting the ESP-EYE pin config works for this board. This suggests the pin mapping is very close to Espressif’s ESP-EYE S3 camera devkit. Some trial and error may be needed if not documented, but the above typical mapping can serve as a guide.

The microSD card slot supports standard microSD/TF cards. In ESP-IDF or Arduino you can use the SD_MMC library (4-line SD mode) or SD (SPI mode). The S3 can use its SD/MMC host interface for 4-bit mode for higher throughput. Typically, the connections might be: SD_CLK, SD_CMD, SD_DATA[0..3] to specific GPIOs (for example, ESP-EYE uses GPIO4, 5, 6, 7, 15, 16 for SD in 1-line mode, but since those are free here, this board likely wires 4-bit: a common S3 SD mapping is CLK=GPIO40, CMD=GPIO41, D0=GPIO42, D1=GPIO2, D2=GPIO1, D3=GPIO0 as an example – again, the actual mapping should be confirmed). If using Arduino, calling SD_MMC.begin() without parameters will try default pins; if it fails, you may need to supply a sdmmc_host_t configuration with the correct pins as per this board’s wiring.

In summary, the board provides a ready-made platform for a camera + Wi-Fi project: you can stream video or capture images and save to SD, leveraging the PSRAM for buffering images (the 8 MB PSRAM is very useful for high-resolution frame buffers and for running algorithms like face detection). The dual-core CPU and vector instructions allow basic image processing or even neural network inference (Espressif’s ESP-DL and NN examples can run on this S3).

Software Support and Libraries

You can program the ESP32-S3 CAM board using the same frameworks as other ESP32 boards: the ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) or the Arduino core for ESP32. The board is essentially an ESP32-S3 DevKit with additional peripherals, so in the Arduino IDE you can select “ESP32S3 Dev Module” as the board. When using Arduino libraries, keep in mind the PSRAM and adjust menu settings to “Enabled 8MB PSRAM” if available, and set Flash size to 16 MB. The Arduino CameraWebServer example can be used – select the appropriate pin definitions (some community forums suggested using the ESP-EYE configuration for this board). There are also Arduino libraries for the OV2640 (the camera driver is part of ESP32 Arduino as esp_camera.h), and for the SD card (SD_MMC.h).

With ESP-IDF, you can use the native examples like esp_webcam or sd_card etc., and configure the pins in menuconfig or in code (via camera_config_t for the camera, and sdmmc_host_t for the SD). Espressif’s documentation covers the LCD/Camera driver and SD/MMC driver, which are utilized under the hood. The ESP-IDF also supports the USB OTG interface (e.g. you can use the TinyUSB stack to make the board act as a USB camera (UVC), a HID device, Mass Storage, or even as a second serial/JTAG for programming itself).

Libraries and Resources: The board being an ESP32-S3 means it is supported by esp32-camera library (for OV2640, etc.), ESP-DSP and ESP-NN libraries (for acceleration using the vector instructions), and all standard Arduino/ESP-IDF components (Wi-Fi, BLE, MQTT, file systems like SPIFFS or FAT on SD, etc.). The 16 MB flash typically is partitioned with space for OTA updates, and the 8 MB PSRAM is detected and used automatically by the camera code (make sure to enable “Support PSRAM” in Arduino menu for ESP32S3).

For development tools, you can use the Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, or Espressif’s own ESP-IDF with Visual Studio Code. The board’s native USB can act as a JTAG debug interface and a UART console (the ESP32-S3 has an internal USB-JTAG/Serial module). If you prefer, you can simply use the UART port and an external USB-UART as well. The Arduino Board Manager package for ESP32 by Espressif already includes support for ESP32-S3. In PlatformIO, you can select the board as “esp32-s3-devkitc-1-n16r8” (since this board is equivalent to a DevKitC-1 with N16R8 configuration). One user reported needing to explicitly configure PSRAM in software for it to work in ESPHome (for example) because of the N16R8 config ￼ – in Arduino/IDF this is usually automatic if enabled.

Documentation & Schematics: As this board is a generic design sold by multiple vendors (sometimes under names like “UICEPAL” or “TopTech ESP32-S3 CAM”), the official Espressif documentation for the ESP32-S3 chip and WROOM module is the primary reference for electrical info. The Espressif ESP32-S3 datasheet and Technical Reference Manual cover the capabilities of the CPU and peripherals in detail. Some community-provided resources include the pinout diagram (as shown above) and even a schematic posted on forums. The schematic (unofficial) confirms the use of the CH340C USB-UART, wiring of the camera connector to various GPIOs, and the dual USB port arrangement. If available, also refer to the AliExpress or vendor product page – they sometimes provide a wiring diagram or a link to a wiki. For example, the DFRobot ESP32-S3 AI Camera (a similar product) has a wiki with sample code and pin definitions which may be applicable.

In summary, the ESP32-S3 N16R8 CAM board is a feature-rich dev board combining the latest ESP32-S3 SoC (with ample Flash/PSRAM) with a camera interface, making it ideal for IoT projects involving vision (security cameras, smart doorbells, AI vision demos) or any project that can benefit from extra RAM and dual USB capabilities. With official frameworks (ESP-IDF, Arduino) and community examples, getting started is straightforward – you can run everything from web camera streams to Tensorflow Lite micro inference on this board. The on-board components (camera connector, SD slot, PSRAM) are fully supported by Espressif’s libraries, and the board design leverages the ESP32-S3’s strengths (like the vector unit and USB) for advanced projects.
